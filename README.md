A handy tool for inserting timing points with non quad signature for example 3/8,
since quaver doesnt support that yet, this program achives this by manipulating bpm.

bpm should be the bpm of the song

count In Bar should be how much line you want in one bar 

  with 3/8 thats 3
 
beat unit should be the note type bars are made of 

  with 3/8 thats a quaver and that 1/8th so you should put 8 in there
